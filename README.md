A digital rendering of the Connect 4 boardgame. 

As a note: there are some ongoing issues with PyGame2.0.0dev6.  
System exit commands within the code will unexpectedly close your PyGame window once a game loop completes.  
In this case, PyGame is ignoring the time.wait function specified in my final if statement.
